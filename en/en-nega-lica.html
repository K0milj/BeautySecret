                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Mesotherapy is a modern, non-invasive, clinically tested and safe method for face and body care.
                        The
                        mesoporation method enables faster and deeper penetration of active substances, which activates
                        cell
                        metabolism. This method is based on the action of a pulse current that allows vitamin and
                        mineral
                        cocktails to penetrate the dermis, where collagen and elastic fibers are synthesized. Cocktails
                        contain active substances necessary for skin regeneration and revitalization. The effects
                        achieved
                        with this treatment are reduction of wrinkles, raising facial tone, hydration of the skin,
                        removal
                        of dark circles under the eyes, as well as other pigmentation on the face, neck and neck line.
                        Mesoporation can also affect parts of the body where cellulite is present. The cocktail has a
                        lipolytic and diuretic effect, which eliminates fat deposits and solves the problem of fluid
                        retention. Herbal extracts and vitamins contained in the cocktail act on the skin, which becomes
                        firmer and tighter. This method is safe and painless, without any side effects after treatment.
                        The
                        treatments are done once a week, and for the full effect, it is necessary to do a series of 6
                        treatments. After the series, in order to maintain the effect, it is enough to do one treatment
                        every two months.

                    <h3>RADIO WAVE LIFTING</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        RTL is an effective, non-surgical treatment for rejuvenating the skin of the face and body.
                        Radio
                        waves act on the dermis, where the heat of the radio waves stimulates elastic fibers and arouses
                        their natural synthesis, which tightens the skin and makes it radiant and shiny. RTL alleviates
                        the
                        existing signs of aging, but also acts preventively, in order to delay the appearance of these
                        signs. Face and body, wrinkles and lines around the eyes, lowered eyelids, bags under the eyes,
                        wrinkles on the forehead and face, relaxed cheeks, nasolabial and neck wrinkles and chin can be
                        treated. Also, relaxed skin of the neck line, chest, arms, abdomen, thighs, knees is treated.
                        The
                        treatments are painless, with no side effects. The long-lasting effect is achieved with a series
                        of
                        3-6 treatments, with an interval of 7-14 days. One treatment every two months is recommended to
                        maintain the effect

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Medical-cosmetic injections are widely used all over the world as a quick solution for all
                        damages
                        which appear through time on the face. The most famous are Botullinum Toxin, hyaluronic acid
                        injection,
                        mesotherapy micro-injections, but the negative aspects that accompany these procedures are high
                        costs,
                        frequency of procedures that become limited over time, pain and discomfort, often dangerous
                        side effects.
                        A safer and cheaper alternative is high-performance, anti-wrinkle treatment:
                        Innovative combination with 3 hi-tech active ingredients that quickly act on facial wrinkles
                    <ul>
                        <li>“NO AGE VXN” antioxidants that slow down the formation of wrinkles</li>
                        <li>“BTX” synaptic agents that relax contractions, leading to wrinkle softening</li>
                        <li>High molecular weight hyaluronic acid for filling wrinkles</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Three very strong and instant effects are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Immunostimulatory effect - "NO AGE VXN" with the effect of reproducing "anti age injection",
                            slows down tissue aging
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The synaptic effect manifested by the SNAP-8 complex acts on the neurotransmitters
                            responsible
                            for wrinkle contractions
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The high molecular weight of hyaluronic acid (2,200 kDa) fills wrinkles: the ability to
                            mobilizes water up to 1000 times its weight.
                            By combining these three dermo-active substances, a therapeutic treatment has been made that
                            devises
                            a real alternative to medical aesthetic injections
                        </li>

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Water is a vital component of the skin. Aging, environment, pollution, exposure to tobacco smoke
                        and
                        sunrays are factors that damage the skin on a daily basis and disrupt hydration in two ways:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lack of hydrolipid film - water drains more easily</li>
                        <li>Lack of natural moisture factor</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        HYDRA CLINIC acts on the skin's natural hydration mechanisms.
                        Operating mechanisms:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This product line is enriched with intelligent hydro-lipids, which have the power to adapt
                            skin hydration levels to humidity levels. They have a double role - production of leather
                            phospholipids in a biomimetic (imitative) way and thus restoring the skin's natural
                            hydrolipid
                            structure.

                        <li>
                            It contains various mechanisms that help distribute water to the skin using "aquaporin"
                            technology.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        It is a well-known fact that oxygen is essential for life. To keep dermal cells in shape
                        to produce the energy necessary for their metabolic processes and thus provide moisture to the
                        skin,
                        it is essential that they are constantly supplied with oxygen. Otherwise, the cells get tired
                        faster
                        and
                        they become susceptible to a condition known as “hypoxic stress”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Residents of urban areas are exposed to low levels of oxygen in the air, pollution, heavy
                        metals,
                        tobacco smoke, the proliferation of bacteria, which lead to skin congestion. Stressed and
                        congested,
                        the skin becomes tired and loses her energy potential.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        BIOPURE treatment is especially intended to eliminate the deep effects of pollution on the skin.
                        This line of products has a strong effect on the skin directly in three ways:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Oxygenation - improved oxygen supply to cells
                        </li>
                        <li>Protection - blocking the effect of harmful microparticles</li>
                        <li>
                            Strong energization - supplying cells with energy and strengthening the skin's defense
                            systems
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the treatment, the skin is cleaner, toned, with a healthy glow, more energetic, and the
                        complexion is fresher and radiant.

                    <p>
                        The external appearance of the face is affected by the facial muscles and subcutaneous fat,
                        whose
                        position is individual on the face. Over time, the fat moves to the lower part of the face and
                        neck,
                        which often causes
                        dissatisfaction in a person who therefore often decides to undergo surgery.
                        ENERGY LIFT treatment delays or even eliminates this solution.
                        The treatment has a double effect:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            drainage and weight loss (cheeks, chin) - localy "attacks" fat on the neck, lower parts
                            cheeks and outer parts of the face
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            firming and tightening - non-surgical reconstruction of the face achieved by combining the
                            effects of softening and wetting, which allow filling of dents and wrinkles
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Facial contours will be reshaped thanks to the synergy of two opposite effects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            MORPHO FILL MASK + MORPHO FILL SERUM: Hyaluronic acid added to this formula allows
                            filling dermal tissue and smoothing wrinkles on the forehead and around the eyes.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        AMESON MESOPEEL is a system based on organic acids with the aim of rejuvenating the skin; makes
                        it
                        brighter, brighter and softer.
                        Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) are molecules of organic origin, whose action depends on the chemical
                        structure, concentration and PH. The Mesopeel line uses mandela, milk and glycol
                        acid. Their effect on the epidermis and dermis has been proven. They are used for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            normalization of the keratinization process, thus enabling the normal functioning of the
                            epidermis
                        </li>
                        <li>activation of the regeneration process, thus increasing the amount of collagen and elastin
                        </li>
                        <li>skin hydration</li>
                        <li>synergistic action to increase other active components</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beta hydroxy acids (BHA), such as salicylic acid, have a keratolytic effect. Their goal is to
                        accelerate exfoliation, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial action, while azelaic acid (AZA) has
                        a
                        similar action.
                        Specific organic acids, their concentrations, pH of exfoliating products and target protocols,
                        make
                        Ameson Mesopeel series superior in addressing the problems of different skin types in different
                        climatic conditions

                    <h3>DERMAPEN</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Dermapen can be classified as a mesotherapy method. This method is far more advanced than
                        of the original techniques of mesoaesthetics. It is one of the best treatments of today, with
                        highly
                        effective results.<br>
                        Dermapen is a device that effectively stimulates collagen synthesis and enables better
                        absorption
                        of cosmetic preparations. The disposable insert on the top of the brace contains a number of
                        needles
                        that stimulate tissue regeneration and inject active substances at the same time. The advantage
                        of
                        this device is that its
                        needles are 5 times thinner and 100 times thicker than others
                        similar apparatus. It is also smaller, which makes it easier to access smaller regions (around
                        the
                        eyes, nose).
                        The treatment is less painful, but also includes the possibility of using a local anesthetic.
                        Its
                        basic advantage is that different skin problems and conditions can be treated during one
                        treatment,
                        because
                        the needles are adjustable from 0.2-2.5mm.<br>
                        By creating programmed and controlled microcracks on the skin, the skin is stimulated to react
                        naturally to the regeneration and creation of new elastic and collagen fibers. Depending on the
                        length of the needles, dermapen can achieve more results - from surface hydration, improved
                        penetration of cosmetics, to the treatment and nourshment of more serious problems (acne scars,
                        damage to skin, deep wrinkles, alopecia, etc.).<br>
                        Indications are numerous: the need to improve the texture and tone of the skin, superficial
                        wrinkles, deep wrinkles, resorption of cosmetics, stretch marks, scars, alopecia, pigmentation,
                        enlarged pores, acne. The treatment is performed on cleansed skin. Different cocktails are added
                        depending on the indication. The goal of the treatment is to reach the subcutaneous tissue,
                        because
                        this
                        is where the problems usually arouse. In this way, they are solved permanently, because it is
                        not a
                        matter of surface treatment that gives short-term results. The results achieved by dermapen are
                        long-lasting. Depending on the goal of the treatment, the results are visible after two weeks
                        (surface treatments: hydration, stain removal…) or in 2-4 months (treatment of scars and other
                        damage, where the results are visible immediately, but a lasting effect is possible only after 2
                        months when new collagen is formed).<br>
                        The treatments are done for a month, and it is necessary to do 3-5 repetitions for extremely
                        visible
                        results. Maintenance is once every 3-6 months.<br>
                        After the treatment, the skin is visibly red and slightly inflamed, so you should avoid exposure
                        to
                        strong sunlight, physical activity, the use of peels and strong preparations 3-4 days after the
                        treatment.
