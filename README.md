BeautySecret is a website that I did for a beauty salon based here in Belgrade. For this project I used: 

✔ HTML5,

✔ CSS3 and

✔ JavaScript.

This is also the first project where I had to translate the entire website to English! It was a really tedious process, but it turned out really good in the end! For now you can visit the website here: https://beautysecret.netlify.app/
